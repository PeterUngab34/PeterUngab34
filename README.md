How to Use the Application
Input Values:

Enter the Voltage (V) and Resistance (R) in the corresponding text fields.
Select the units for Voltage (e.g., V, mV, kV) and Resistance (e.g., Ω, kΩ, MΩ).
Calculate Circuit Values:

Press the Calculate button to compute the Current (I) and Power (P).
The results will be displayed in the respective fields.
Clear Fields:

Press the Clear button to reset all input fields and output fields.
Save Calculation History:

Press the Save button to save your calculation history to a text file (calculation_history.txt).
Exit the Application:

Press the Exit button to close the application.
Dark Mode:

Toggle the Dark Mode checkbox to switch between light and dark themes.
Additional Notes
Unit Conversion:
The program automatically converts voltage and resistance based on the selected units. For example, if you input millivolts (mV), the program will convert it to volts (V) before performing calculations.
History File:
The history of calculations is saved to a file named calculation_history.txt. Each calculation is stored with the voltage, resistance, current, and power values for future reference.
Error Handling:
The program checks for negative or invalid input and will display an error message if the input is incorrect (e.g., entering text instead of numbers).
Requirements:
Java version 8 or higher is required to compile and run the application.
By following these instructions, you should be able to compile, run, and use the Enhanced Circuit Analyzer efficiently for your circuit analysis needs.
